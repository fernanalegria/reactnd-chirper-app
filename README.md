# Chirper Project

Social media app that lets you post messages and read, like and reply to other users' messages

This repo is a code-along with the first project in the [React Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019). However, it has been structured using ducks in order to make it scalable. Check out the benefits of this approach in [Scaling your Redux App with ducks](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/scaling-your-redux-app-with-ducks-6115955638be)
